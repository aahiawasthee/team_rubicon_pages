                    <li><span>I’ve signed up, what else do I need to do in order to deploy?</span>
                        <br>In order to deploy, members must have completed the following:
                        <ul class="social">
                            <li>- <a href="#">Module 1</a></li>
                            <li>- <a href="#">ICS 100 &amp; 700</a></li>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Do I need health insurance to deploy?</span>
                        <br>Yes, Team Rubicon requires Greyshirts to have health insurance given the inherently dangerous nature of disaster response operations. All operations (mitigation, response, recovery), projects, and training events require our members to maintain coverage in the event of personal injury. In order to take care of others on their worst day, our members need to take care of themselves first. If you are covered by VA Health Benefits, you're covered and can still deploy.</li>
                    <li><span>How does Team Rubicon decide when to conduct an operation? How does planning begin?</span>
                        <br>Disaster response resources can be found <a href="https://teamrubiconusa.org/doctrine/">here</a>. You can also watch our video regarding the <a href="https://vimeo.com/140876334">Concept of Operations</a>. </li>
                    <li><span>How do I start signing up for operations? How will I be notified? Why haven’t I received any information in the past?</span>
                        <br>When an operation is approved, a notification will be sent out to members within a 450-mile radius of the incident (so make sure your address and region are accurate in your profile). For larger operations (Type 1-3), TR will purchase flights to the operation for vetted members. For all flight ops, members must be available for 8 days on scene. If you are not receiving the notifications:

                    </li>
                    <li><span>How do I know I have selected for an operation?</span>
                        <br>You will receive a set of dispatch instructions from our Membership team. Members are selected based on the proximity, availability, and personal readiness of our badass volunteers. <a href="https://teamrubiconusa.org/blog/what-it-takes-to-deploy-domestically/">Read more about domestic deployment here. </a></li>
                    <li><span>How much will it cost me to deploy?</span>
                        <br>In short, all you donate is your time, sweat, and willingness to help others. <a href="https://teamrubiconusa.app.box.com/files/0/f/21964245075/1/f_149508104787">TR will offset mileage</a> and/or flights, lodging, food and drinks during your deployment. TR will also provide the necessary equipment and supplies, but asks that volunteers bring their own <a href="http://www">personal gear.</a></li>
                    <li><span>The dispatch instructions don’t tell me enough, how can I find out more about my deployment?</span>
                        <br>The onsite POC listed on your dispatch instructions can help provide more op specific information once you check in with them to confirm your arrival time. General questions about what to expect on deployment can be answered by the leader who dispatched you. </li>
                    <li><span>Does TR offer additional training besides Module 1 and Pre-Deployment Basic?</span>
                        <br> Definitely! Check out our Training page, search for something on our Basic Training page, or check out the follow events for a session near you!*

                        <br>No. We leave firearms, illegal knives, or any other weapon at home. I'm licensed to carry the weapon? No. I'm keeping it in my personally owned vehicle? Still no.</li>
                    <li><span>Can I bring my service animal?</span>
                        <br>Yes. The furrier, the merrier! Team Rubicon adheres to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and does not require any information for service animals to deploy. For more information, read our policy <a href="https://teamrubiconusa.box.com/s/xce9ak4xqm5d942uv18xai9k9j6lsdu1">here</a>.</li>

                        <br>At Team Rubicon, we earn our grey shirts. Get out to a service project or deploy on an op to step into the grey and get your hands on a grey shirt.</li>
                    <li><span>Can I bring my kids to Team Rubicon events or operations?</span>
                        <br>No, the heart of a disaster zone is no place for kids. Bring your above ankle work boots and hard charging spirit, and get ready to get dirty.</li>
                    <li><span>Can I abbreviate Team Rubicon to just Rubicon?</span>
                        <br>No way! We'll call you by your name and you call us by ours. We're proud of our name as it becomes synonymous with disaster response. More importantly, we are a team and that is our strength.</li>
                    <li><span>How do I leave Team Rubicon?</span>
                        <br>While we would be sad to see you go, we understand if the time or situation is not right. Please submit a ticket to our <a href="http://help.teamrubiconusa.org/">HelpDesk</a> and we’ll begin the process of inactivating your profile.</li>
